# Wikimarks


## Example: Horseshoe Crab

We provide an example of the outputs of our conversion pipeline and how we create Wikimarks for several tasks.

The topic ``Horseshoe crab`` has articles on both English Wikipedias

*  English Wikipedia [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_crab)
* Simple English Wikipedia [article](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_crab)

We will provide outputs of these examples as generated by our conversion pipeline.

## Dump Conversion

The first phase will convert the raw Wikipedia dump into an easily-machine readable format.

1. download the Wikipedia and Wikidata dumps, 
2. parse the Wikitext format
3. resolve redirects, disambiguation pages, and categories and expose them as metadata for each article

We call the outputs of this phase "unprocessed", which is technically not true (we came to regret the name), 
but it is unprocessed in the sense that all pieces of information from the original Wikipedia article are preserved.


## Processing and Filtering

The next phase will further process the "unprocessed" dump by 

1. removing non-article pages,
2. removing administrative section headings (like "References", "See also" etc)
3. removing infoboxes and images (although the pipeline can be configured to preserve those)
4. Optionally, near-duplicate paragraphs can be deduplicated -- this can be important as there are many articles written by copying-pasting-modifying existing articles.
6. a corpus of all paragraphs across all Wikipedia articles is extracted

We call the outputs of this phase "processed".

The two example articles will look as follows

* English Wikipedia: [page in JSON](http://trec-car.cs.unh.edu/wikimarks/datareleases/horseshoe-crab.article-en.json)
* Simple English Wikipedia: [page in JSON](http://trec-car.cs.unh.edu/wikimarks/datareleases/horseshoe-crab.article-simple.json)

## Subset selection

During the next phase, different page subsets can be selected to provide a corpus of interest. 
This could be a random subset of all pages to obtain a smaller collection, or a pages within a set of categories, or articles of 
different quality levels (such as good or vital articles) or a list of pages that were manually selected, or retrieved from Wikidata's SPARQL endpoint.

See the main page for a list of [example subsets](wikimarks.html) for which subsets are provided and 
instructions for how to configure the [pipeline](code.html) to produce subsets of your choice.

We select just the article on horseshoe crabs via its Wikidata QID

```
{ name = "horseshoe-crab";
  predicate = "qid-in-set [\"Q1329239\"]";
}
```

Each subset is automatically divided into train and test splits, and each train split is provided in five folds to enable machine learning with cross-validation.


## Wikimark extraction

The final step is to extract different Wikimarks (i.e., Wikipedia-derived benchmarks) from each article. We offer Wikimarks for a set up common IR tasks. In all cases the title of the Wikipedia page constitutes the search query, which is interpreted as an information need on "Tell me about ....". In this case the information need is "Tell me about Horseshoe crabs".

Please see [Wikimarks](wikimarks.html) page for further information on how Wikimarks are derived.

### Passage retrieval

**Task** Given a query, retrieve relevant passages from the passageCorpus (produced in step 6 of the processing phase). Every paragraph that was given on the original Wikipedia article (after processing) is regarded relevant. All other paragraphs are regarded non-relevant.

Example qrels for English:

```


We provide qrels for different derived information needs:

- article-level (query = "Horseshoe crab"): 
- top-level (e.g. query = "Horseshoe crab / Threats"):
- hierarchical (e.g. query = "Horseshoe crab / Threats / Harvest for blood")


### Entity retrieval

**Task** Given a query, retrieve relevant entities from all Wikipedia entities (as given in the `unprocessedAll` or `unprocessedAllButBenchmark` collections). All entities which are linked to from the original article are regarded relevant (all other's non-relevant).

Example qrels for English:

```
enwiki:Horseshoe%20crab 0 enwiki:Amebocyte 1
enwiki:Horseshoe%20crab 0 enwiki:Arachnid 1
enwiki:Horseshoe%20crab 0 enwiki:Arthropod 1

- top-level (e.g. query = "Horseshoe crab / Threats"):

### Query-specific Clustering

**Task** Given a query and a set of relevant paragraphs, produce clusters to represent relevant subtopics. As a ground truth, all paragraphs in the same top-level section are regarded as a cluster. The set of paragraphs provided on the article is taken as a set of relevant paragraphs.

  ],
  "query_id": "enwiki:Horseshoe%20crab"
****              
```

The `true_cluster_idx` correspond to the following section headings of the article

- 0: Anatomy and behavior
- 1: Breeding
- 2: Taxonomy
- 3: Threats


For example the first paragraph `04f754dba54b26bab09823bcc19bc31227ca6125` is supposed to be clustered with paragraph `08fa5fda300d14d27687bd00341c176a2aff2f39` as these are both in the section on "Threats" (idx 3).




### Query-specific Entity Linking

**Task** Given a query and the text of a paragraph, identify entity mentions in this paragraph and annotate them with their Wikipedia entity ids. These paragraphs are taken from article, of which the hyperlinks are removed. We take every span in the paragrpah that was originally annotated with a hyperlink to another Wikipedia page as a true span, and the entity it is linked to as a true entity.
